# If you deploy your application to several instances be sure to use the same key!

# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Defaults to Global in the root package.

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#
# db.default.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
# db.default.url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/stock_exchange"
# db.default.user="stock"
# db.default.pass="stock"
